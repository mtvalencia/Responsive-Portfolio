                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mario and I am trying to enhance my web development skills by completing this course.
                         I hope to learn more about jQuery, NodeJS, and MongoDB. I am excited to learn something very interesting and then turn around and apply it.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to become the best full stack developer in the industry and I want to create innovative web applications that will simplify the life of the user. </p>
                    <p>Comeback to my site in a few weeks. You should see more of my work here as I complete each project. </p>
